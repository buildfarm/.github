# Welcome to the buildfarm organization page!

buildfarm is an Open Source remote caching and execution system for the [Remote Execution API](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis)

You can get started using buildfarm with [bazel](https://bazel.build) by following our [Quickstart](https://bazelbuild.github.io/bazel-buildfarm/docs/quick_start/)

For detailed information on how buildfarm works, and how you can make it work for you, start looking through our [Documentation](https://bazelbuild.github.io/bazel-buildfarm/docs)
